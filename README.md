# Sentiment-Analysis
The Repository provides the personal project I worked on the tweets of US airlines data for calculating the sentiments which provides the proper sentimental analysis when I started my journey in the field of data science.

1. Loading the data and the necessary libraries
2. Data Preprocessing

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Visualizing the sentiments of each airline
5. Frequency of words in positive sentiments
6. Predicting the tweet sentiments with text data

7. Evaluation of these models using the confusion matrix
